# Airline Passenger Satisfaction

As the COVID  cases seem to decrease in the past few months, many people are turning 
towards travel, more than in pre-COVID times, as there were lockdowns and quarantines for most 
of the time. There are over 5000 airline choices and it was an 872-billion-dollar revenue before 
the pandemic. This way, airlines have the best time to improve their businesses and make up for 
the loss in the past few years. For that, companies would turn towards achieving higher passenger 
satisfaction and look for ways to evaluate their service. 
 
The inclusion of the expectations accomplishes two objectives: 
- It can first be used to examine the factors that affect satisfaction. 
- The dataset may be split into independent components and dependent factors in order to 
develop models that forecast consumer satisfaction (the satisfaction column). 

In order to develop a remedy or proposal to forecast the behaviors of passenger satisfaction levels, 
the Airline Passenger Satisfaction Survey requested assistance from its data analytics team. We 
selected the dataset below, which shows consumer happiness over time, as part of our 
investigation. 
 
## BUSINESS PROBLEM: 
 
   Airline passengers are generally divided into Business class and Economy class. Business 
class tickets often cost 4 to 5 times as much as economy class tickets. It indicates that compared 
to economy class, business class generates 3 to 5 times more income for airlines. The data analysis 
team will thus focus on a business class of travellers. Airlines may learn what regions have room 
for service development after reviewing the data, and they can also investigate the crucial elements 
that influence consumer happiness. The airline firm asks the data analysis team to look into and 
forecast which aircraft services may be enhanced without damaging the economy class to boost 
the number of customers who select business class travel. Following data research, changes must 
be  made  to  encourage  more  people  to  choose  the  business  class.  Meaning  that  airlines  may 
comprehend which regions have room for service enhancement and also study the crucial elements 
that influence consumer contentment. 
 
The analysis of customer feedback data is currently being used to pinpoint the amenities that might 
significantly increase the number of consumers and enhance the airline company. For every facility 
offered by the airline, we have ratings from over 100k consumers, along with a final happy, neutral, 
or unsatisfied comment. 

**How are we using data to answer the business problem?**

1.  Creating  regression  model  for  business  class  passengers  and  economy  class  passengers 
separately. 

2. Comparing the statistically significant variable estimates from both business and 
economy class. 

3.  Using  variables  with  high  statistical  significance  to  business  class  for  building  various 
algorithms for the entire dataset.  


*CONCLUSION AND MANAGERIAL INSIGHTS* 
 
- According to our model, the very relevant factors for business class are Online_Boarding, 
Type of travel, Cleanliness, Leg_room_service, Baggage Handling, 
IMP_Arrival_Delay_In_Minutes, Onboard_Service, Customer_Type, Checkin_Service 
 
- From the resultant variable, we can observe that the three most important variables for the 
enhancement of the business class sale are online boarding, the kind of trip, and cleanliness. 
 
- Given that the aforementioned amenities provide a sizable profit for business class travelers 
while  causing  little  to  no  change  for  those  traveling  in  economy  class,  we  advise  the 
managerial team to make more efforts to improve them. To see a noticeable difference in 
the number of passengers, we advise the managerial team to alter these factors. 
 
- As  business  class  passengers  invest  more  money,  they  expect  the  onboard  process  to  be 
easy and not much time-consuming. We suggest the team make changes according to that 
and make it easier for the business class passengers. 
 
- We also suggest to the team to understand the passenger's purpose of traveling at the time 
of booking whether the passenger is traveling for business or for personal so that we can 
display ticketing options accordingly. 
 
- We  suggest  the  team  make  sure  to  take  extra  effort  to  keep  the  area  clean  by  keeping 
individual sanitizers to individual seats and keeping the fixed intervals cleaning service to 
make sure the area looks clean always. 
 
- We hope our data analysis and suggestions from it will help in improving business class 
sales without affecting economy class sales.
